The judgment of man  
Befalls the rebellious and  
Righteous --  
The former condemned in righteous hatred,  
The latter asbsolved in righteous vindication.  
Rain falls,

Yet for this time,  
In this cold and brittle earth,  
The rebellious man lifts his head  
To the descending rainfall  
Seeping beneath his soil, by which  
He eats, lives, and will be buried.  

The Life-Giver graces the rebellious man  
With life in a redeemable image,  
For the Rain-Maker has come once and  
Died in His own image.

But the rebellious man, looking upwards,  
Cries to the heavens  
Shouting to curse the sky and its Maker.  
For the sky and its rain poured down so heavily  
That the floods rose and swept away  
His only daughter,  
Never to breathe again.  

Despite the unjust world against her innocence,  
The rain continues to pour,  
Unwavering and unanswered by the angry soul  
Wanting an answer from the Rain-Maker.

Expelling his being into the mist  
Not far above his quivering lips and  
Bloodshot eyes,  
He rages, rages, rages --  
Until his heart turns into sorrow.

He weeps, weeps, weeps,  
Hoping that the sorrow  
Will leave with his tears,  
Yet he finds no comfort  
Sinking his knees deeper into the irriguous dirt.

And so the rain pours.

Though, to the man, the callous of sorrow  
Cannot be cleansed by this earthly water,  
But must be cleansed by living water;  
The Rain-Maker showers both,  
Yet only one to the righteous.

So the Rain-Maker prods  
At the rapid beating of the unjust's heart --  
For while it is sorrowful, rebellious,  
And unrighteous,  
The man and the Rain-Maker  
Share in their image, and in that image  
A heart --  
Though shattered, as the mind of the man,  
He can have the blood of the Life-Giver,  
The Rain-Maker,  
Heal his sinful wounds  
And the scars lacerated by the edges  
Of this cold and brittle earth.

No longer to hope for hope,  
But to hope in Hope,  
And have a Hope that heals  
The rebellious heart,  
Making righteous  
By a Man --  
No, far more than a mere man --  
Who shared the same image,  
The same hands,  
Yet His pierced by nails.
