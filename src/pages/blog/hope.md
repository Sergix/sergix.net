Peace, at last,  
As we face the familiar image  
Granted to our souls by the spirit  
We have been endowed.  

From the aperture of our being we gaze  
Upon the dust of the earth,  
Reminding ourselves of the vale  
From which we came.  

Our home resides not between the walls of this edifice  
Constructed by our soul's visage,  
But rather in the euphoric garden  
Of which our soul desires.  

A peaceful garden,  
Clothed with lilies  
And hopeful spirits,  
The eternal vineyard.  

Our soul continues to examine  
The vessel in which it resides.  
"The hope of the hopeful has succumbed to the hopeless,  
The flesh of my being."  

Peace forsakes the soul.

Desperate and enlightened  
Our soul rages against its Maker  
Departing from the path of the garden  
Into the depths of the earth.  

Raging, raging, raging.  

The spirit is dead!  
Die, hope!  
For the prospect surpasses reach,  
Beyond the garden's gate lies salvation.  

Mortal, our flesh,  
Ceasing with the refrain of the soul.  
Mind has torched the garden,  
Its lilies scorch the sky.  

Rage, rage, rage!  

This vaporous life drowns meaning  
Within the depths of our eyes,  
Blind to the sunset that approaches.  

		 reach!
	reach,
Reach,   

Reach aloft and seize the fading light!    
This empty chamber narrows --
Dark shadows lurch from the corners,  
My chained soul writhes in dread.

( The chamber is the mind,  
  The chains are the flesh! )

Free my captive being.  
Rupture these shackles!  

Capture the elusive hope  
Veiled within my heart.  

Hope,  

Hope,  

Hope.  

Night is fast advancing,  
Giving way soon to its end.  
The Light of this world has now risen,  
And the sun no longer is dead.  

Refuse to give way to the flesh,  
For it will burn along with the mind.  
Give way to the Spirit,  
For the garden has quenched the flame.
